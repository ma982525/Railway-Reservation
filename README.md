# Railway Reservation
 This application is a simple demonstration of Railway Reservation System where we can search for train from particular location to another location on particular date.
 
 We can view intermediate trains, distance, and we calculate cost of ticket according to the distance.
 
 At max we can add 6 travellers while booking at a single time.
 
 Trains data are manually added from backend in database directly, no admin console is there as of now.
 
 Searching and sorting are done in an optimal way to reduce time while fetching intermediate trains and data.
 
 No Payment Integration is attached yet or no train classes added. This is a simple represention of the system.
